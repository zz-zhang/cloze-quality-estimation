{"article": "Buddy, five years old, is traveling with his parents to enjoy a taste of adventure. He is only 600 miles away from  _  the youngest-ever hiker to complete the Appalachian Trail  .  _  they started their journey, they were told that the youngest person to ever  _  the trail was a six-year-old who hiked it in 1980. The couple hadn't set out to  _  any records. \"We don't know he was setting the record  _  until after we started.\" his mother said.\nThe group travels  _  . They just have the main  _  item being an iPad Mini that they use to plot   their route and  _  shelters along the way. They also have a Jeep to get them to the trail heads each day, a  _  that has sheltered them through all kinds of weather, and a Marmot thick jacket to protect Buddy on  _  trails. They post updates about Buddy's progress and  _  to their website.\nInstead of going to  _  Buddy has the outside world as his classroom and listens to  _  CDs. \"He hikes with educational music, which is  _  . He's learning French, he's learning to count, spell, add and subtract   while he hikes without the  _  of other kids or being in the classroom. He can focus on his study,\" his mother said.\nThe couple  _  that unlike other hikers Buddy's age gave him the  _  of unlimited energy. \"He  _  hurts the next morning like most hikers do. He's had it  _  than most hikers,\" his parents said.\nThe adventures of the youngster, who has scaled mountains, camped in snow and met wild horses, will be  _  into a children's book once he has completed the last 600 miles. They plan to finish on New Year's Eve.", "source": "cbt_high463", "options": [["bring", "\"Amazing", "up\",Sobbing", "becoming"], ["weight.So", "When", "Whenever", "When"], ["do,\"", "complete", "pointing.", "others;"], ["talk,", "please,\"", "break", "college?"], ["officially", "regretfully", "bike", "confidently"], ["ripped", "light", "shaken", ".We"], ["contest---'On", "expensive", "reputation.", "uncorrected,"], ["waddle", "find", "hate", "wrong:even"], ["presents,", "city.Monaco", "tent", "berry"], ["windy", "graduates,whose", "really?", "jar."], ["transmission", "route", "scallops", "said,\"then"], ["minutes,\"she", "brakes.", "my!", "school"], ["There's", "educational", "landing.", "rain"], ["30-pound", "well-behaved,", "neatly-typed", "wonderful"], ["distraction", "blossom", "prayed", "onstage"], ["finished", "figures,", "added", "strengthened"], ["advantage", "post80s", "place.\"", "record:\""], ["dramatically", "\"Very", "never", "liberally"], ["easier", "calmer", "you're", "\"Before"], ["inspired", "over.", "turned", "spent"]], "answers": ["D", "B", "B", "C", "A", "B", "B", "B", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B", "D", "A", "C", "A", "C", "A", "C"]}
