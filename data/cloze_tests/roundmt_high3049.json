Mom wanted me to attend a famous \n  _   school, and I wanted to go to a small writing college. Every night for two weeks, we argued, shouted and gave   _   treatments until both sides went to bed with regrets.\nIt was mostly my   _  . Since my junior year of high school, I had   _   at being a nurse. I took all the science courses, and even worked as a 40 _  in my town's local hospital. My   _   was to help the sick and be superwoman to the world.\nYet,   _   graduation and college neared, it all changed.
