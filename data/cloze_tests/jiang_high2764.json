{"article": "In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh  treated the poor message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news. However, if the exhausted runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his  _  was cut off.Shades of that spirit spread over today's conversations. Once a friend and I  _  up some peanut butter and sandwiches for an outing. We were walking light heartedly out the door, picnic basket in hand,  _  a  _  neighbor looked up at the sky and said, \"Oh boy,   _   day for a picnic. The weatherman says it's going to rain.\" I wanted to  _  him on the face with the peanut butter and sandwiches. Not for his stupid weather report, for his smile.Several months ago I was  _  to catch a bus. As I put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter  _  , the sales agent said with a broad smile, \"Oh that bus  _  five minutes ago. \" Dreams of head-cutting!It's not the  _  that makes someone angry,  _  it's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered. Everyone must  _  bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper  _  . A doctor advising a patient that she need an operation does it in a caring way. A boss  _  an employee he didn't get the job  _  a sympathetic tone. Big winners know, when delivering any bad news, they should share the feeling of the receiver.Unfortunately, many people are not  _  of this. When youare tired  _  a long flight, has a hotel clerk  _  said that your room isn't ready yet? It makes you as  _  want to land your fist right on their unsympathetic faces.Had my neighbor told me of the upcoming  _  with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warming. Big winners, when they bear bad news, deliver bombs with the emotion the bombarded person is sure to have.", "source": "jiang_high2764", "options": [["preservation", "head", "improper", "stepson"], ["sheets", "packed", "slips", "colds"], ["wherever", "whenever", "were", "when"], ["strapping", "smiling", "drifting", "invading"], ["stumble", "bad", "famous", "self-destructive"], ["preservation", "improper", "strike", "min"], ["racing", "strapping", "drifting", "invading"], ["sudenly", "breathlessly", "golly", "shelly"], ["stepson", "left", "preservation", "improper"], ["improper", "news", "preservation", "min"], ["neither", "bucephalus", "but", "plus"], ["give", "improve", "rewritten", "continue"], ["improper", "attitude", "preservation", "min"], ["drifting", "informing", "invading", "strapping"], ["sheets", "slips", "colds", "adopts"], ["stumble", "fifty-three", "aware", "intuitive"], ["below", "across", "teachers?what", "from"], ["shelly", "cheerfully", "golly", "sudenly"], ["colds", "sheets", "travelers", "slips"], ["oc17", "min", "rainstorm", "improper"]], "answers": ["B", "B", "D", "B", "B", "C", "A", "B", "B", "B", "C", "A", "B", "B", "D", "C", "D", "B", "C", "C"]}
