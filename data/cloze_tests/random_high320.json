{"article": "Perhaps the only test score that I remember is the 41. I was in high school. The test was the final for the class. It was a rather  _  test. I didn't know how  _  I had done but I knew there were things on  _  that I didn't know. I remember  _  waiting for the result. When Mr. Bales  _  my paper on my desk, I was  _  . There in big  _  numbers, circled to draw attention, was my grade -- 41! I  _  my paper so that others couldn't see it. A 41 was not  _  that you wanted your classmates to see. Finally, Mr. Bales stood behind the desk and  _  the class. \"The grades were not very good;  _  of you passed,\" he announced. \" The highest grade in the class was a 41, so all of you failed.\" A 41. That was me. Suddenly my dismal face didn't look quite so bad. I had the highest grade. I felt a lot  _  . As soon as I got home, my mother asked me, \"How did you do on your test?\" \"I made a 41,\" I said. My mother's  _  changed suddenly. \"You failed.\" \"But I had the highest grade in the class!\" I replied. \" I don't  _  what everyone else had. You failed. It doesn't matter if everyone else failed too; what matters is what you do,\" my mother  _  answered. For years, I thought that was a harsh judgment. My mother was always that  _  . It didn't matter what the other kids did; it only mattered what I did and  _  I did it excellently. We often don't understand the wisdom of good parents until we ourselves stand  _  the parenting shoes. My mother's philosophy has  _  me throughout life. The path of the crowd is wide but the path to pass the tests of life is  _  and there are very few people on it.", "source": "random_high320", "options": [["weakened", "difficult", "advice.", "selfish,"], ["misfortunes", "ideal", "well", "witch's"], ["it", "steamboat.", "alone.", "removing"], ["strikes.", "anxiously", "time,we", "stretching"], ["sip", "ads,", "(8th", "dropped"], ["big-wave", "shocked", "temperature", "now."], ["red", "overwhelmed", "routine", "roots.Life"], ["Queen", "sincerely,", "hid", "life--GIVING."], ["shovel", "complained.", "are,", "something"], ["Disneyland", "Hello.", "envied", "addressed"], ["Ugly's", "none", "chest!", "ask"], ["thread.Sometimes", "better", "\"Thank", "opposites"], ["considerate", "expression", "difficult.", "car's"], ["modern", "care", "pass,", "\"He's"], ["44-year-old", "\"Boy,", "firmly", "AND"], ["sister,Mary,", "laughs", "way", "wrote,"], ["figures.", "marked", "that", "feeling59"], ["in", "arrived,", "two-o-o-o!\"", "away.Sorry"], ["flagman,", "might", "supported", "workers\""], ["blindness.In", "AL", "narrow", "power-driven,"]], "answers": ["B", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B", "A", "C", "D", "D", "B", "B", "B", "B", "C", "C", "C", "A", "C", "C"]}
