{"article": "My Forever Valentine\"\"\nValentine's Day was the time my father chose to show his love for the special people in his life. Over the years I fondly   thought  _  him as my \"Valentine man\".\nMy first recollection of the  _  he could bring to Valentine's Day came when I was six. That morning at the breakfast table I found a card and a gift-wrapped package at my chair. The card was  _  \"Love, Dad\" and the gift was a ring with a small piece of red glass to  _  my birthstone, a ruby  . There is  _  difference between red glass and rubies to a child of six, and I remember  _  that ring with pride that all the cards in the world  _  not surpass  .\n  _  I grew older, the gifts gave  _  to heart-shaped boxes filled with my  _  chocolate and always included a  _  card signed \"Love, Dad\". In those years my thank-you became  _  of a perfunctory   response. The cards seemed less  _  , and I took for granted that the Valentine would  _  be there. I had  _  my hopes and dreams in receiving cards and gifts from \"significant others\" and \"Love Dad\" just didn't seem quite  _  .\nHis final card remains on my desk today. It's a  _  of how special fathers can be and how important it has been to me over the years to know that I had a father who continued a  _  of love with simple acts of understanding and an ability to express happiness over the people in his life.\nThose things never  _  , nor does the memory of a man who never  _  being my Valentine.", "source": "cbt_high2817", "options": [["valuable.", "tall.", "of", "below"], ["steaming", "magic", "realities.", "display."], ["written.", "me.", "signed", "dreamed"], ["smiling.", "represent", "drink!\"", "safe."], ["great!", "\"Just", "dizzy.", "little"], ["wearing", ";scraping", "eying", "raining"], ["night,\"", "straight", "could", "was."], ["\"Honey,", "oh", "though", "As"], ["way", "cold.March", "bent", "p.m."], ["hot-key", "pocket", "favorite", "mainstream.\""], ["special", "unreachable", "six-and-a-half", "speak"], ["heard", "more", "lighter", "yelling."], ["one-legged", "important", "satisfactory", "eight!"], ["always", "impossible.", "ahead", "amazing."], ["roots,", "excluded", "deep", "placed"], ["immediately", "Sadly", "enough", ".They"], ["reminder", "ground,to", "home,\"", "way,try"], ["thinking?", "tradition", "science.", "mother.She"], ["die", "apologize,give", "saved!\"", "\"borrow\""], ["stopped", "tolerated", "stopped", "set"]], "answers": ["C", "B", "C", "B", "D", "A", "C", "D", "A", "C", "A", "B", "B", "A", "D", "C", "A", "B", "A", "A"]}
