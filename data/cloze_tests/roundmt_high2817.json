{"article": "My Forever Valentine\"\"\nValentine's Day was the time my father chose to show his love for the special people in his life. Over the years I fondly   thought  _  him as my \"Valentine man\".\nMy first recollection of the  _  he could bring to Valentine's Day came when I was six. That morning at the breakfast table I found a card and a gift-wrapped package at my chair. The card was  _  \"Love, Dad\" and the gift was a ring with a small piece of red glass to  _  my birthstone, a ruby  . There is  _  difference between red glass and rubies to a child of six, and I remember  _  that ring with pride that all the cards in the world  _  not surpass  .\n  _  I grew older, the gifts gave  _  to heart-shaped boxes filled with my  _  chocolate and always included a  _  card signed \"Love, Dad\". In those years my thank-you became  _  of a perfunctory   response. The cards seemed less  _  , and I took for granted that the Valentine would  _  be there. I had  _  my hopes and dreams in receiving cards and gifts from \"significant others\" and \"Love Dad\" just didn't seem quite  _  .\nHis final card remains on my desk today. It's a  _  of how special fathers can be and how important it has been to me over the years to know that I had a father who continued a  _  of love with simple acts of understanding and an ability to express happiness over the people in his life.\nThose things never  _  , nor does the memory of a man who never  _  being my Valentine.", "source": "roundmt_high2817", "options": [["of", "on", "for", "with"], ["magic", "clue", "insight", "magical"], ["made", "captioned", "see", "signed"], ["represent", "reflect", "illustrate", "off"], ["great", "real", "\"nt\"", "little"], ["ring", "wearing", "thinking", "reddening"], ["might", "would", "could", "may"], ["that", "by", "for", "as"], ["rise", "place", "way", "substitute"], ["favorite", "preferred", "favoured", "own"], ["special", "weird", "dark", "odd"], ["better", "greater", "less", "more"], ["nonimportant", "taking", "nonsignificant", "important"], ["very", "then", "not", "always"], ["told", "\"\"", "placed", "looked"], ["lot", "close", "enough", "insincere"], ["reminder", "fact", "reminding", "throwback"], ["out", "tradition", "habit", "alive"], ["alive", "feel", "help", "die"], ["transcended", "stopped", "transpired", "made"]], "answers": ["A", "A", "D", "A", "D", "B", "C", "D", "C", "A", "A", "D", "D", "D", "C", "C", "A", "B", "D", "B"]}
