Mary looked for a while at the blue cloth and began to cut it. Then she  _  her paper in half and began writing. When Mary finally looked at the message the teacher gave on the paper, she noticed something else. She felt her  _  grow hot---she hadn't heard that anyone who didn't have a mother could make one for a grandmother or an aunt.

When school was over, Mary  _  until all the other kids left so that she could apologize . \"I'm sorry for not listening. I'll make another card  _  you want. I'll do it at home and  _  it tomorrow.\" \"  _  are you talking about?\" asked Mrs. Berry. \"My Mother's Day card. I know you're sad because I didn't do it  _  .\" \"Mary, that was the  _  card in the whole class. It was so  _  that it made me cry. \" Mary was so  _  that she ran out of the classroom.

Inside the card she had written: Dear Dad, I know you work really hard to be both a  _  and a father. I want to thank you and  _  you a Happy Mother's Day!
