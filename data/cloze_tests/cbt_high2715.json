{"article": "One day I met a man in the hospital, who needed blood to save his daughter. He was struggling to get blood for her and curiously  _  my blood type. My blood type was the same needed for his daughter. Before that I  _  donated my blood, so I was afraid of doing this and didn't know what to do. Then suddenly I saw a little girl in the hospital, who was  _  from a critical disease and needed blood from her six-year-old brother. Yes, from her younger brother, why? His brother had  _  suffered with the same disease and by God's kindness  _  by developing the anti-bodies needed to fight for the disease. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the boy if he would be  _  to give his blood to his sister. I saw him  _  for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, \"Yes, I'll do it if it will save my sister.\" As the transfusion progressed, he smiled, seeing the  _  returning to her sister's cheeks. But suddenly, his face grew pale and his  _  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a  _  voice, \"Am I going to die?\" Being young, the boy had  _  the doctor; he thought he was going to give her all his blood and  _  his life. I felt  _  , when that young boy,  _  the fact of blood donation, got ready to give his blood, thinking that he will lose his life but save his sister's life. And I, being a mature person, knowing that this will not  _  my life, I will not lose my life,  _  save others' lives and I was hesitant of doing this. That moment  _  my thoughts and I became enthusiastic about doing this important duty and felt that true  _  by helping save that little girl's life. If any patient dies due to a blood shortage, I will not call this the  _  of doctors, as science is still not able to make blood artificially. Only we can save others' lives  _  donating blood.", "source": "cbt_high2715", "options": [["reappeared", "then,", "twisted", "asked"], ["never", "young,because", "$20.", "names"], ["camping", "suffering", "shaking", "evening"], ["also", "consciously", "attract,", "hungrily"], ["declined", "survived", "banged", "diagnosed"], ["guys.", "alcoholism,", "schools,", "willing"], ["cry,", "fight,", "run.", "hesitate"], ["boys.", "envelopes,", "things.It's", "color"], ["happier,", "plates,", "credit", "smile"], ["rebuilding", "sacrificing", "praying", "trembling"], ["fifteen.", "overturned", "grounded.", "misunderstood"], ["lose", "make.\"", "email", "get.\"Just"], ["begun.\"", "attempted", "confused", "ashamed"], ["unknowing", "marrying", "fluttering", "stumbling"], ["\"The", "affect", "love.", "knowledge:"], ["but", "Neither", "\"Er", "Nevertheless,"], ["typed", "robbed", "combined", "changed"], ["sandbox", "hole.Then", "happiness", "notebook.\"It"], ["moment.He", "shows.", "fault", "mother--I"], ["anywhere,", "by", "bad!", "promising,"]], "answers": ["D", "A", "B", "A", "B", "D", "D", "D", "D", "D", "D", "A", "D", "A", "B", "A", "D", "C", "C", "B"]}
