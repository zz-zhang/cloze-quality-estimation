We found friends of friends, far across the county, over a   _  , beyond the highway. They would be glad to give him a new home. He   _   beside me as I drove him there. And I left him tearfully, watching him on his new front porch, disappearing in the   _   of the rear view mirror   as I drove away from him forever. \nA year later, in our new home, we got a call from the people who bought our farmhouse and Ann   _   the phone. \"There's a strange black dog   _   up here a couple days ago.
