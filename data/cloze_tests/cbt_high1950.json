{"article": "A Very Special Special Olympian\nThe professor was searching for student volunteers in the lecture room for a Special Olympics event. As the sign-up sheet went up and down the rows, I started to come up with my  _  . Maybe it was the distance to the college where the event was to take place, or the early hour that   _   had to report for duty. Whatever the reasons that made me hesitate, I am thankful to this day that I   _   up volunteering. If I had missed the event, I would have missed one of the most unforgettable moments that I have ever   _  .\nI arrived at the volunteer tent bright and early. My task was   _  . I was to stand at the finish line only and wait until the event was over and then take the   _   to the announcing booth . Standing at the finish line, I was able to witness many amazing efforts and close races. I was most impressed by the effort each athlete put into his or her   _  . What also impressed me was the sincere   _   each athlete expressed while participating though sometimes the joy of participating in a sporting event can get 44 _  in the fierce competition of winning and losing.\nThen an amazing moment happened right before my eyes. A group of athletes were   _   \nup to run a short race. One of them was in a wheelchair, a little girl with a   _   smile, wearing bright bows in her hair. Her smile filled the stadium that day. I couldn't help but smile back at her.\nThe gun sounded. They were off. Runners sped up in the   _   with all their might. My eyes\n  _   for the little girl with the bright bows. There she was, pumping her arms with all the \n  _   she had. Her efforts were getting little result, but that did not stop her. I noticed as she got closer that she also had an injured arm. But that did not stop this bright star. The race was long over   _   the young athlete kept pumping her arms. As she finally   _   the finish line, the noise of the crowd was thunderous. There I stood  _  , with tears falling down my cheeks. \nAfter all these years, I can still hear those cheers. I wish I could thank that remarkable athlete for what her efforts   _   this unmotivated college guy. I grew up a lot that day because of the   _   of that little girl in the wheelchair. I was   _   that day of a poem from a book that states, \"Whatever you do, do it with all your might.\"", "source": "cbt_high1950", "options": [["excuses", "'BULLETS!'", "won't", "nature."], ["volunteers", "antidepressants", "landfills", "day,a"], ["ended", "like?\"", "toldMoviesOnline.", "days,"], ["constructive.\"", "richer.", "witnessed", "like,"], ["person.", "43-year-old", "\"It's", "simple"], ["praises.", "villagers.", "lip\".", "result"], ["collection!\"", "event", "grace.", "hadn't"], ["\"Sorry,", "worker,", "own?", "joy"], ["worried.", "combined", "away.", "lost"], ["donated", "mixed", "five.", "lined"], ["busy", "automatic.", "heavy", "huge"], ["matters.She", "became42", "servant.", "track"], ["restarted", "scared,\"", "searched", "children."], ["eye,", "energy", "evening,Brownie's", "portraits,"], ["but", "\"My", "\"Finally,\"Glanz", "\"Susan"], ["happen,", "decided", "videotaped", "neared"], ["eating,", "cheering", "pleasing", "potting"], ["question.", "taught", "supported", "andno"], ["flashlights,", "(interesting", "happened,Seppala", "bravery"], ["occurred", "reminded", "advertised", "examined"]], "answers": ["A", "A", "A", "C", "D", "D", "B", "D", "D", "D", "D", "D", "C", "B", "A", "D", "B", "B", "D", "B"]}
