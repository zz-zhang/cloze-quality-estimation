{"article": "Persistence paid off\nWhen I graduated, I was by no means an exceptionally talented web developer. Like many graduates, I was clueless which   _   to take when I left university, so I took a couple of gap years traveling around North America. After traveling , I returned home and   _   in a restaurant where I was offered an assistant manager role.   _   the offer was appealing, it occurred to me that if I didn't start inspiring my enthusiasm, soon I would find myself relying on a(n)    _    wage and stuck in a career routine.\nAt this time, in 2002, the digital industry was booming in the UK, and after looking into this area   _   , I realized I was very interested in   _   a career in web development. The main question was: \"where do I start?\" I had very little   _   knowledge or indeed skills in web development, and I couldn't get a job without the experience and skills   _   my belt. So, I put everything I had into learning more and finding a job in web-designing industry. I   _   my    resume by post to every digital agency within 100 miles -- making it clear I was   _   to work without pay if I could gain experience. This brought a few   _  ,but nothing which   _   my career ambitions or me.\nHaving   _   to find myself a training position within a company, I realized that if I wanted to get into this industry I would need to   _   my own opportunities. So, I asked a friend who owned a pub if I could create a website for him. I even asked for a small upfront payment which   _   me to complete the site quickly and to the   _   standard. It proved to be a great website, and a good investment for my friend, as it attracted new customers. Eventually, I   _   a local web development agency -- which had already turned me down twice! -- to take a look at my work. The company was   _   that I was not going to give up on my passion, decided to take me      _   . \nAfter being offered the post, I've learned when it comes to careers, persistence often pays off. It demonstrates enthusiasm, commitment and drive; all attractive   _   in the eyes of an employer. So, don't give up if you don't get the placement or role first time round -- sometimes persistence is all it takes to catch an employer's eye.", "source": "roundmt_high3006", "options": [["branch", "direction", "area", "trip"], ["went", "worked", "joined", "took"], ["as", "although", "by", "though"], ["regular", "irregular", "untenable", "full"], ["again", "therefore", "further", "back"], ["continuing", "paying", "stopping", "seeking"], ["local", "operational", "practicable", "practical"], ["that", "on", "under", "for"], ["mapped", "sent", "emailed", "was"], ["interested", "give", "willing", "free"], ["options", "responses", "opportunities", "decisions"], ["taught", "made", "had", "suited"], ["worked", "refused", "struggled", "failed"], ["have", "build", "made", "create"], ["told", "pushed", "made", "caused"], ["desired", "hoped", "wanted", "wished"], ["checked", "convinced", "caught", "made"], ["impressed", "obvious", "clear", "strong"], ["though", "on", "for", "that"], ["qualities", "properties", "attributes", "aspects"]], "answers": ["B", "B", "B", "A", "C", "D", "D", "C", "B", "C", "B", "D", "D", "D", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B", "A"]}
