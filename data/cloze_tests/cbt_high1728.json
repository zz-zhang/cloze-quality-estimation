{"article": "My 4-year-old son now enjoys posting letters. He has formed the  _  of drawing pictures, writing his name on them, and then  _  the artwork in an envelope. He then insists on  _  his handwork to the neighbors, and a mail box he  _  belongs to the elderly couple who live next door. To be  _  , I didn't think much of it, but I had  _  to warn my neighbors of the drawings  _  appearing in their letterboxes--I just didn't have the  _  to do so, because I was a little busy recently. On Tuesday of last week, I was walking down to school to collect my son when I  _  Mary, my elderly neighbor,  _  at her mail box. She said, \"Jodie, is it your little son that has been posting items in my letterbox to me?\" I was at once  _  , \"Oh yes, Mary, it is. I'm sorry. I meant to tell you...\" She cut me off, \"Jodie, I just love his mail. I've  _  every item he has sent. You don't know how much  _  the letters has made my day. I just love them.\" While I was walking down to school after our  _  , many thoughts came to me. Mary doesn't have a lot to fill her days,  _  she was a mother to a number of children herself who receives fairly regular visitors. The small  _  of getting some mail--pictures drawn by the hand of a young child--has brought  _  to her days, just as my visit to my grandparents does. I have decided that my son should  _  this practice. He should also start sending some items to his grandparents in Perth as well. It will most  _  make their day. It's doing the little, simple things that can often make a big  _  in someone's life.", "source": "cbt_high1728", "options": [["possible.", "mistress", "habit", "greediness"], ["hiding", "splitting", "steadying", "putting"], ["overcoming", "doing", "posting", "placing"], ["her,turned", "begged.", "chose", "guarded"], ["Best", "worst", "highest", "honest"], ["searched", "glared", "meant", "grounded."], ["something.", "suddenly", "immediately,", "over.I"], ["selfdiscipline,selfmotivation", "minutes,Dr.Welch", "presence", "time"], ["applied", "agency,", "climbed", "met"], ["war!", "standing", "avenue", "so,"], ["blessed.\"", "interested", "stocked", "embarrassed"], ["kept", "wears,", "attacked", "rippled"], ["shooting", "materials,including", "worried.", "receiving"], ["hamburger", "shine?", "hairdresser", "talk"], ["once?", "now!", "Whenever", "although"], ["her.It", "boy'", "act", "commentator."], ["to12", "things?", "ski,", "happiness"], ["kind.", "heaven,", "think:", "continue"], ["\"Obviously", "certainly", "it.Here", "without."], ["path,", "difference", "universe", "moves,"]], "answers": ["C", "D", "C", "C", "D", "C", "B", "D", "D", "B", "D", "A", "D", "D", "D", "C", "D", "D", "B", "B"]}
