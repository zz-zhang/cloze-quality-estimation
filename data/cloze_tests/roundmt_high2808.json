{"article": "A single mother and her daughter living in my community are two of the most unfriendly people I have ever come across in my life. They are totally  _  , mixing with nobody. As they drive past neighbors they keep their eyes looking away and make no sign of  _  other people. The only fame they have is making a nuisance   of themselves to the local police station by  _  music played too loud, dogs barking more than once a day and any other little  _  .\nUpon moving into this neighborhood, I was  _  of these two but decided I would make up my own mind. This proved quite a  _  to me as more than once either the mother or the daughter would knock on my door and blast ( ) me with some  _  or other. I  _  answered politely and made sure I  _  as they went past my place and also made the effort now and then to make a kind  _  about their garden or pets.\nTime passed and in October, as part of the Kindness Rock Give, Maureen and I decided to place a kindness rock in their garden. Their  _  remained unchanged, however, and I continued to be as friendly as possible. During the Easter give, we decided once again to  _  these two unhappy ladies to our list and  _  a packet of cookies on their gate. Imagine my  _  when two days later they  _  at my gate and jokingly said they were  _  hanging their Christmas stocking on their gate, and they brought me a bunch of flowers!\nSo, my fellow gifters, do not give up on your random gifts of kindness. You may never  _  just what this  _  to others, nor how many broken or  _  hearted people you may just change  _  a simple act of kindness.", "source": "roundmt_high2808", "options": [["disunited", "separated", "disengaged", "dissociated"], ["responding", "reacting", "welcoming", "greeting"], ["putting", "broadcasting", "reporting", "hearing"], ["affairs", "sorts", "dealings", "sounds"], ["seen", "given", "gained", "warned"], ["impact", "distress", "challenge", "task"], ["feelings", "complaints", "things", "questions"], ["ever", "very", "always", "just"], ["protected", "was", "waved", "held"], ["idea", "remark", "image", "admire"], ["touch", "person", "\"s\"", "attitude"], ["join", "invite", "add", "made"], ["kept", "reserved", "left", "gave"], ["surprise", "struck", "amazement", "marvel"], ["walked", "made", "ended", "stopped"], ["considering", "thinking", "going", "contemplating"], ["know", "hear", "out", "learn"], ["signifies", "does", "means", "has"], ["hard", "much", "ugly", "else"], ["that", "for", "with", "by"]], "answers": ["B", "D", "C", "A", "D", "C", "B", "C", "C", "B", "D", "C", "C", "A", "D", "A", "A", "C", "A", "C"]}
