{"article": "Many years ago,Mr. Smith asked me to be the referee on the grading of an examination question. He was about to give a student a  _  for his answer to a physics question,while the student said he should receive a perfect  _  ,I read the examination question:\"Show how it is possible to  _  the height of a tall building with the  _  of a barometer .\"\nThe student had answered: \"Take the barometer to the top of the building, fasten a  _  rope to it,  _  the barometer to the street, and then bring it up,  _  the length of the rope. That's the  _  .\"\nI pointed out that the student really have a strong case for full credit ,since he had answered the question  _  , but the answer did not prove competencein physics. I  _  that the student have another try. I gave the student six minutes, with the  _  that his answer should show some  _  of physics.\nHis answer reads:\"Take the barometer to the top of the building and lean  _  the edge of the roof. Drop the barometer,  _  its fall with a stop watch. Then using the formulas=1/2at2,calculate the height of the building.\"\nI gave the student  _  full credit.\nBefore I left, the student said he had  _  answers. He said,\" The best way is  _  to knock at the building manager's  door. When he  _  ,you say: \"Sir, I have a (n)  _  barometer. If you will tell me the height of the building, I will  _  you this barometer.\"", "source": "cbt_high2328", "options": [["newness", "zero", "miserable,", "midday"], ["sun.\"", "hard.I'm", "trunkload.", "score"], ["him!\"", "me.In", "d(,", "determine"], ["aid", "once", "experiment", "seat.\""], ["long", "treats.", "afraid,", "\"49"], ["softer", "her,", "lower", "smaller"], ["cleaning", "measuring", "---fighting", "beerdrinking"], ["height", "anymore.", "marathoner.", "zoo's"], ["habitually", "correctly", "sometimes,", "away,so"], ["bottled", "admitted", ".Not", "suggested"], ["warning", "photographer", "roll", "teacher,\"Teacher,I'm"], ["hour,I'm", "kids,\"", "robot", "knowledge"], [",\"said", "others.\"", "public.", "on"], ["conquering", "observing", "heaving", "surfing"], ["briefly", "photos", "gum.", "thoughts.\""], ["some", "that", "again.", "\"What"], ["violently", "probably", "free", "fifteen,"], ["wastes", "shouts", "dragons.", "worse,"], ["dull", "life...\"", "fast-track", "purpose"], ["begin,the", "bear", "ache.", "give"]], "answers": ["B", "D", "D", "A", "A", "C", "B", "A", "B", "D", "A", "D", "D", "B", "A", "A", "B", "B", "A", "D"]}
